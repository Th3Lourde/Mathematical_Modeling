People are rowing a boat. There is an idea that the more oarsmen that there are in a boat, the faster that the boat will travel.

Investigate whether or not there is a mathematical relationship between the speed of a boat and the number of crew members.

Assumptions:
- The total force exerted by the crew is constant for a particular crew throughout the race
- The drage force experienced by the boat as it moves through the water is proportional to the square of the velocity times the wet surface area of the hull
- Work is defined as force times distance. Power is defined as work per unit time



Is there a mathematical relationship between the speed of the boat and the number of crew members in the boat?

What we can do is prove that the more crew members there are in the boat, the higher the power output of the boat is. 

Create a mathematical model that predicts the work of the boat given the number of crew members. Use this model to predict time.

Create another mathematical model that predicts the power of the boat given the number of crew members. Use this model to predict time.

It would make more sense that power is more reasonable than force becu
