No final exam, final project

Monday is usually a lecture

Wed is more interactive

Friday reports back to proffessor

Supposed to be very workshop oriented

Quick Presentations, not a lot of time

Assume HW will be collected

Exam April 12th


Deterministic vs. Stochastic and Emperical vs. Mechanistic:

A deterministic system is one that has no randomness

A stochastic system is one that has randomness

A emperical system is one that is based on observations/prior data and not all of the theory

A mechanistic model is one that is based upon the theory of/behind a certain field

Examples:

Deterministic and Emperical: Predict Cattle growth based on food intake

Stochastic and Emperical: An Analysis of variation of yields from different sites or periods of time

Note: Year-to-year, or something that differs year-to-year would be a stochastic model and not an emperical model

Stochastic and Mechanistic: Genetics - population growths and characteristics (Based on theory with chaos being in the system)

Deterministic Mechanistic: Planetary Motion (where is the moon going to be in the sky, where is planet x going to be, etc...)

What is the goal of the model?

What assumptions are we making? (Chaos no chaos) (theory no theory)
