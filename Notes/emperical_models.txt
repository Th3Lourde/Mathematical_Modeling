* Data suggests the model
* Need to estimate parameters
* Testing needed

Two methods of making the models:
* Interpolation: finding a function that contains all of the data in it.
* Model fitting: finding a function that is close to the data, regression
* Coefficient of determination or correlation coefficient. 
  - Expressed at r or r^2, r:[-1,1] r^2:[0,1]
  - We want r^2 > 0.9

Different types of models:
* Linear: y=mx + b simplest, most common, works
  - if b is small, we can just say that y is proportional to x

* Quadratic model: y= ax^2+bx+c
 - Good approach if we have one max or one min

* Cubic y = ax^3 +bx^2 +cx + d
 - One min and one max

* Quartic and higher, general polynomial functions
 - Useful for interpolation only (means that don't use it to predict outside of the given data range)

* Exponential y = ab^x yae^kx
 - Constant relative (percent) constant growth
 - What k is determines if the graph is increasing or decreasing
 
* Logarithmic y = a+b*ln(x)
 - b > 0, concave down, increasing
 - b < 0, concave up, decreasing 

* Logistic growth
 - y = (c)/(1+a*e^(-bx)))
 - Used for classification problems
 - b > 0, reaches capacity as x --> infinity
 - b < 0, reaches capacity at the beginning

* Power functions
 - ax^b
 - long range growth is not as rapid as exponential growth

Connecting with linear model:
 - y = ax^b
 - ln(y) = ln(a) + b*ln(x) 
 - or -
 - y = a*b^x
 - ln(y) = ln(a) + x*ln(b)


Linear function: y depends linearly on x
Power function: ln(y) depends linearly on ln(x)
Exponential function: ln(y) depends linearly on x
Logarithmic function: y depends linearly on ln(x)
